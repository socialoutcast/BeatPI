3. Power on the Pi
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for initial setup
5. The screen will display setup instructions with your device's IP address

### Complete Setup
1. From any computer on the same network, open a web browser
2. Navigate to the HTTPS URL shown on your Pi's screen
3. Accept the security certificate warning (it's a self-signed certificate)
4. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `changeme`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
   - Change the admin password
   - Configure Spotify
   - Set up parental controls

## Troubleshooting

### No Display on Screen
- Initial setup takes 2-3 minutes
- Check power supply (low voltage indicator in admin panel)
- Verify HDMI connection

### Can't Access Admin Panel
- Ensure your computer is on the same network as the Pi
- Try using the IP address directly: `https://<IP-ADDRESS>`
- Accept the self-signed certificate warning

### Network Issues
- Ethernet is most reliable for initial setup
- If using WiFi, double-check credentials in Pi Imager
- Country code must match your location for WiFi to work
